An environment-- a spacious area in nature, maybe a town.  
First Nations communities-members coming to cities from their original environments can at their free choice stay, work, eat, develop skills do arts,.. alone and with families in return for helping cultivate the environment/community in an organized way. They can live there and prosper for as much as they want. Fully secure, with full dignity.
